# Abstract:
Despite the continued research and progress in building secure systems, Android applications continue to be ridden with vulnerabilities, necessitating effective detection methods. Current strategies involving static and dynamic analysis tools come with limitations like overwhelming number of false positives and limited scope of analysis which make either difficult to adopt. Over the past years, machine learning based approaches have been extensively explored for vulnerability detection, but its real-world applicability is constrained by data requirements and feature engineering challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their vast parameters, have shown tremendous potential in understanding semnatics in human as well as programming languages. We dive into the efficacy of LLMs for detecting vulnerabilities in the context of Android security. We focus on building an AI-driven workflow to assist developers in identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities. Our experiments show that LLMs outperform our expectations in finding issues within applications correctly flagging insecure apps in 91.67% of cases in the Ghera benchmark. We use inferences from our experiments towards building a robust and actionable vulnerability detection system and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our experiments also shed light on how different various simple configurations can affect the True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) rates.
